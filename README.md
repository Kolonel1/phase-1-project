PROJECT NAME:Personal website
AUTHOR: Victor Munyao
LICENSES:none



This is my first personal website just the layout not a complete build 
Has the recommendations page which satisfies all the requirements for the independent project  .so please make sure to check that.
 This site has its own local api which i have deployed to heroku
I have deployed this site on both heroku,netlify and github pages 
This site was the bench mark or the starting point to be more precise to nurture my creative skills and i still have a long way to go.

I have created or my aim for creating this site is that I understand, that as a user one may want to know about my skills set,experience,character etc.
Since I see a bright future and expect it to come to fruition it is only natural that I have a platform to showcase my skills and this is just the beginning.

In my opinion,I would have preferred to do even more work on this but it was quite unfortunate that at the time in which we were submitting our project forms I was quite far behind and did not have the luxury of researching some more and what I had in mind at the time of the submission of the forms was the idea of a site,but my inexperience and somewhat lack of creativity deeply hindered my progress.
I know for a fact that I do not have an artistic mind but learn through experience.
I hope to transform this site into a remarkable interactive site which i will be proud of.
